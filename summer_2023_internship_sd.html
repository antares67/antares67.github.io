      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my internship at NASA's Glenn Research Center, I was invited to participate in a student design challenge along with other interns. <br>
        For this project my team and I designed, built and tested a dual axis light tracking solar panel mount under vaccuum.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
      Spacefaring vehicles such as the International Space Station very often utilize solar panels as a source of electrical power. 
      A significant problem which needs to be accounted for during the design of solar systems is light tracking. In order to maximize power
      generation, a solar tracking mount needs to maximize the amount of time the solar panels face the sun. 
      <br>
      <br>
      My team was tasked with solving this problem on a small scale over the course of three weeks. We would also need to take into 
      <br>
      account the fact that we would be testing under vaccuum. This mean we needed to design our mount entirely out of vaccuum safe materials.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
      I was responsible for all electronic design during the course of this project. We were provided with a number of premade 
      hardware components to use in addition to an Arduino Mega including an MPTT solar battery charger and buck boost converters.
      We were given total freedom of how we could apply the hardware componets we were supplied with. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The following diagram depicts how I chose to lay out the electronics.

      <p>
      Once the design was finalized, I laid out the power electronics on a 3D printed board for organization (top left). Sensor connections 
      were organized on a perf board which was mounted centrally on the 3D printed solar panel mount (bottom left).
