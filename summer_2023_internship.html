      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to intern at NASA's Glenn Research Center for the summer of 2023 as a test engineering intern. 
         I worked at Glenn's Power Systems Facility where novel power systems for space applications are developed. 
         I contributed to a project known as AMPS (Advanced Modular Power System) by creating a GUI to display system data. </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="motivation">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The AMPS project had a previous solution for the system data GUI. A display with an embedded microcontroller 
           was being used, however, these displays proved to be unreliable. A failed display is pictured below (left). </p> <br>
           
           <img src="media\AMPS_failed_display.jpg" alt="Failed display" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"> <br>
           
           <p>The AMPS team wanted a new browser based GUI running on a Raspberry Pi. I was assigned the task of designing one from scratch.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="design">
        <h2>Design</h2> 
        <p>Major challenges of this project included: <br>
          <br>
            - Communicating with DAQ units and reading valid sensor values <br>
            - Parsing DAQ readings and interpreting if they are within normal operating ranges <br>
            - Displaying values on a GUI which can be easily interpreted by a user</p>
      <img src="media\AMPS_display_hardware.jpg" alt="self picture" style="width:435;height:435px; display: inline;">
      <p>
      The final design is depicted above and below. A Raspberry Pi was used to communicate with two Omega D6400 DAQ units. 
      An intermediary device was used to convert from USB to the RS485 protocol in order to read and write from the DAQs.
      <br>
      A timer relay was also used to function as a watchdog timer which would shut off if the system froze, or if the system 
      detected a sensor value out outside of the normal operating range. 
      <br> 
      <br>
      The Raspberry Pi was connected to and powered by a touchscreen display.
    </p>

      <p>
      Javascript and Python were used for reading, parsing and displaying data. Below is a simple diagram showing
      how the MQTT protocol was used to interface Python with Javascript.  
      </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <img src="media\AMPS_display_result1.jpg" alt="self picture" style="width:650;height:650px; display: inline;">
        <p>The project was successfully completed and fully integrated into the AMPS rack. 
          <br>
          <br>
          In instances when sensor values stray beyond user defined limits, the system will respond by placing itself into an alarm state.
          In this alarm state, the timer relay controlled by the Raspberry Pi is opened and the system will shut down. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The system will remain in this state until the sensor value returns to normal and a user clears the alarm state. 
        This behavior is demonstrated below.
